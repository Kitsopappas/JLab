	/*
	 * Here are few benefits or advantage of using final keyword in Java:
	 * 
	 * 1. Final keyword improves performance. Not just JVM can cache final
	 * variable but also application can cache frequently use final variables.
	 * 
	 * 2. Final variables are safe to share in multi-threading environment
	 * without additional synchronization overhead.
	 * 
	 * 3. Final keyword allows JVM to optimized method, variable or class.
